Item: Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0102536v1>
Date: 2001-02-28 20:12:09 UTC
The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.

Item: Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate electrons
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0608371v1>
Date: 2006-08-17 14:05:46 UTC
We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.

Item: Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron Flux Spectra in Solar Flares
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.4225v1>
Date: 2007-07-28 09:32:22 UTC
Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$ keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray spectrum steeper at high energies. Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated electrons. We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung. Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E = 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy exists.

Item: Improved scenario of baryogenesis
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9904306v1>
Date: 1999-04-22 15:54:59 UTC
It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry. Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference. At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as protons and electrons.

Item: Exact Electron-Pairing Ground States of Tight-Binding Models with Local Attractive Interactions
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0310615v1>
Date: 2003-10-27 08:59:02 UTC
We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models exhibit an electron-pair condensation.

Item: Electron-electron interactions in a weakly screened two-dimensional electron system
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0205001v1>
Date: 2002-04-30 20:00:18 UTC
We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on liquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both the independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interacting electron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drude theory as a function of electron density.

Item: First-principles calculations of hot-electron lifetimes in metals
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0002322v1>
Date: 2000-02-21 11:53:06 UTC
First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energy electrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates are evaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we compute within the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are then obtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full inclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also reported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the band structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller than those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in Be, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the density of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$ electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions yields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in a free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$) electrons.

Item: Electronic Properties Of Buckminsterfullerenes: Degeneracies and Surprises
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9610058v1>
Date: 1996-10-08 14:08:55 UTC
Buckminsterfullerene compounds exibit remarkable physics at low temperatures, e.g. high temperature superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes, and ferromagnetism in TDAE -C60. Here we review recent theoretical studies of electron correlations in these compounds. In particular, we discuss models of electron-vibron interactions, electron-electron interactions, and intermolecular hopping. We show that the origin of novel electronic phases lies in {\em local} degeneracies of C60; a direct consequence of the high molecular symmetry.

Item: Energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron liquid
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.206804>
Date: 2007-08-03 14:34:40 UTC
The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems is studied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation in which the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends on the electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rate is found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of the electron system.

Item: Shear viscosity of degenerate electron matter
<http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3893v1>
Date: 2008-03-27 11:38:09 UTC
We calculate the partial electron shear viscosity $\eta_{ee}$ limited by electron-electron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly suppresses $\eta_{ee}$ in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons and modifies its %asymptotic temperature behavior. The efficiency of the electron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars is analyzed.
