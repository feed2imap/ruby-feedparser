So MIT's Technology Review[1] has named me as one of their TR35[2] -- the top 35 innovators under the age of thirty-five. It's a great honor, especially because the other honorees are /actually/ working on things like cures for cancer[3] and rocket science[4] -- domains that I have known only as rhetorical flourish. Should you like to hear me make a jackass out of myself on the subject, you might want to check out Richard Giles[5]'s latest I/O podcast[6], in which he interviewed me about the award.
