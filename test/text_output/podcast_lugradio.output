Jono Bacon, Stuart Langridge & Ade Bradshaw talk about their first day at Guadec[1], including interviews with:

- Mirco MÃ¼ller
- Aaron Bockover

This is the first of (hopefully) five mini episodes that we are recording while at Guadec.

Its worth saying that we have had a few microphone issues, so please forgive the occasional crackle

Its also worth mentioning that we used Jokosher for the recording, this is the first time we have used it and its gone quite well all things considered

Enjoy and stay turned for the rest.
