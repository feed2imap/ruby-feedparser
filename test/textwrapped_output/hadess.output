Yay! Got pilot-link[1] to sync over Bluetooth, without the crappy 'Set 
up a PPP server' bit. Now to download BtSync[2].

First day at Uni[1], registration, seeing the faces of my new 
classmates. Definitely the eldest one, the Frenchest one (not the 
foreignest one, there are 2 Russian girls in the class), and the only 
one doing it part-time. So I started skipping this afternoon (/Welcome 
to the bestest Uni in England/ and /Where do I do sports/ that's mostly 
interesting to 18-year olds who've never left home, like, hmm, most of 
them). Only the fresher's drinks to go to tomorrow, so I can try and get 
over the flu I picked up this week-end.

Done a bit of work on Bluetooth, mainly research, and general updating. 
Fredrik Noring[2] has joined in to help with the ever-distant 
gnome-bluetooth-manager[3]. Busy adding new features to libbtctl for 
now, the fun work will come a bit later.

Watched Team America[4]. Would be a funny film if it didn't feel so 
true.

Lazy Web, oh Lazy Web, can you tell me a good Obex FTP client for Palm 
OS?

PS: Texas Chainsaw Massacre[1] sucks. And Calum[2] will be happy we only 
managed a draw[3]. Glory hunter, my arse.

You'd think that Brits would get behind the England and Wales team 
winning the Ashes[1], but no[2]. Calum, you're cheap. I hope Motherwell 
loses (again)[1].

All hail to McGratthie!

Could have been a fest, was a feast. Good and bad together.
Oldboy[1], as advised by Jakub[2], a real treat, and a reminescence of 
Shinobi.
Robin Hood: Men In Tights[3], another Mel Brooks, not as funny as I 
remembered when I watched it more than 10 years ago.
Akira[4], which I'm probably one of the few to have watched after 
Metropolis[5], definitely one of the good mangas, although not really my 
style (I'd choose Ghost In The Shell[6] or Spirited Away[7] over 
/Akira/).
Anchorman[8], you can't believe the romance for a minute, and the jokes 
are rubbish.
Angela's Ashes[9], very much an inspiration for later films like Billy 
Elliot[10] or In America[11].

I also took some time to get DAAP sharing working with Rhythmbox, thanks 
ish[12] for the work, I can now stream good music over the waves. Some 
more g-p-m[13] love, and we might be ready for another release soon.

He got the 10 wickets out yesterday already! (Cricket lovers, don't 
despair, it's a private joke).

[A]

/Since Fluendo[1]'s inception, xine lovers have gone underground/

Breakthrough in gnome-phone-manager[2] hacking. No need for a phone, I 
can have a dummy one! Implemented the dummy backend, which allowed me to 
fix one bug, and reproduce another one. Now to bug Ross about the 
contact-lookup-applet's widget disabling itself when there's no 
completion in Evolution, and waiting for a restart to enable itself.

And time! It's about time that I finish blogging about my trip to 
Barcelona[1]. Day 4, nice, got to visit the Sagrada Familia[2]. Very 
nice, convoluted, interweaved, and really overdone. After that, it all 
goes downhill.

[A]

/Over-engineered/

Puketastic on the Thursday, don't know if it's the Barcelona water, or 
Christian's fridge contents, but the result wasn't anything for the 
weak.

I started my Friday recovery with the Fluendo[3] guys. I left, shortly 
after a failed attempt at setting a projector: if you can't get a room 
dark, a projector isn't very useful. Spent the evening with Andy and his 
bunch of cosmopolitan housemates. Meeting Cyril was funny, I was 
speaking English, and him Spanish before Andy, in his well-known style, 
blurted out /"But you're both French, you idiots"/. Out to 
Danzatoria[4]: I can find Radio 2 DJs that can mix hip-hop better than 
the guy there. Good to know that young Israelis make jokes about the 
Holocaust. That still doesn't allow you to repeat the anti-semitic jokes 
your grand-father Helmut was telling you when you were a kid.

Saturday, footie with Christian, in an Irish pub managed by Frenchmen. 
England won it by the skin of their teeth. Then a good BBQ at 
Thomas[5]', he's got the gear, but you can pick on him for using xmms on 
his entertainment systems. Welcome to the 1990's. And time to say good 
bye to everyone, on my way back on the Sunday.

I wouldn't live in Barcelona, but it's certainly a good place to have 
friends in, thanks guys.

*Back to the routine*

Or not quite. I've received my welcome pack for UniS[6], starts Monday 
19th. And I'll be going to Boston for the Summit[7] (thanks Havoc for 
sorting it out), and after that to Raleigh to meet my new boss.

*Random bits*

Watched Spaceballs[8] (full of one-liners, but was certainly more 
entertaining to watch in the '80s) and Hitch[9] (got no excuses, again). 
And Christian, in addition to having a Crazy Frog Background[10], also 
has the Crazy Frog music in his collection[11].

So the evening was a tiny bit more eventful than prepared. First, Andrew 
Patrick (the good guy Wingo's mom name) got us down to a very nice tapas 
bar. Then, it got more furious. We ended up in Moog, and on the way I 
got offered unaldurated sex (for a fee), hachish, my balls grabbed 
(gratis), and 20 euros nicked out of my backpocket (gratis, again). The 
club was good, easy 80's upstairs, and hardcore noughts downstairs. The 
skinny really white guy standing next to me near the end was, well, 
Scottish. Would you believe. It's close to 6, and the second part of the 
night didn't go through. Shame, time to sleep now. Tada.

After my problems with plane tickets, I still managed to make it to 
sunny Bacelona. I say sunny, but it's an understatement. For some 
reason, I'm a sweaty guy, and whether or not the thermometer in 
Christian[1]'s flat tells the truth (stuck as it is on 30 celsius), it 
is damn hot, and my two showers a day compulsory if I want to go into 
the world.

I started my integration on Sunday, when after a few sips at a beach 
bar, we headed to an Irish pub, to watch Newcastle v. ManU[2]. My home 
studies (read: the FIFA tournament on Friday evenings) came to use when 
I called Luque a /Tronco/, and the barkeep laughed. Headed towards a 
Thai restaurant (the original plan having failed, see below).

[A]

/Totum, not Totem, and it was closed. So close Andy.../

Next day, woke up late, tried to go to the Picasso museum. Closed on 
Mondays. My debit card to buy a /Metro/ travelcard, nearly eaten by the 
machine (saved by the keys, McGyver-style). Instead, I hung out at the 
Fluendo[3] offices, and made a trip to the aquarium. I couldn't find how 
to disable the flash on my damn camera, so ended up taking only one 
picture. The other picture I got was from me standing next to a guy in a 
shark suit. It's like Disneyland in Catalan.

[B]

/Not a nudie booth/

Yesterday evening, we went to a Mexican (apparently a bad one, it wasn't 
actually so bad), and then to see La Isla[4]. I found the film really 
bad, and Thomas not so much. I guess Thomas has the culinary taste, and 
I have the film one.

[C]

/Well high/

Today was a late one again, and I strolled to /Monjuic/ via the 
/Teleferic/ after lunch at the Italian restaurant.

Another couple of days still, so it's going to be fun. Much thanks to 
Christian for the hosting, and the Fluendo guys (even the Aussies!) for 
company.

It's happened to me twice that I bought my tickets for the wrong week. 
One week off on the booking, and you end up paying more because you're 
not careful. I manage to top it this time, by booking my trip to 
Barcelona in the wrong direction. 160 quid later, I'm going in the right 
direction...
