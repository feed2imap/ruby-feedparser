Title: Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies

<p>The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration
interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the
pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective
electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the
scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero
electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this
smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.
We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both
with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective
electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of
the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not
significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction
for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to
popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting
factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.</p>

Title: Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate electrons

<p>We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas
taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau
damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic
electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner
crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity
completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion
(electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron
conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.</p>

Title: Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron Flux Spectra in Solar Flares

<p>Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to
the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E
= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron
spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy
exists.</p>

<p>It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the
mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of
particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry.
Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference.
At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons
annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as
protons and electrons.</p>

Title: Exact Electron-Pairing Ground States of Tight-Binding Models with Local Attractive Interactions

Content:
<p>We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The
models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms
and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of
electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground
state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models
exhibit an electron-pair condensation.</p>

<p>We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using
magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on
liquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are two
orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both the
independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interacting
electron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drude
theory as a function of electron density.</p>

Content:
<p>First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energy
electrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates are
evaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we compute
within the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are then
obtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full
inclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also
reported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the
band structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller
than those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in
Be, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the
density of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$
electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions
yields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in a
free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$)
electrons.</p>

<p>Buckminsterfullerene compounds exibit remarkable physics at low temperatures,
e.g. high temperature superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes, and
ferromagnetism in TDAE -C60. Here we review recent theoretical studies of
electron correlations in these compounds. In particular, we discuss models of
electron-vibron interactions, electron-electron interactions, and
intermolecular hopping. We show that the origin of novel electronic phases lies
in {\em local} degeneracies of C60; a direct consequence of the high molecular
symmetry.</p>

<p>The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems is
studied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation in
which the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends on
the electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rate
is found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of the
electron system.</p>

<p>We calculate the partial electron shear viscosity $\eta_{ee}$ limited by
electron-electron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into
account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly
suppresses $\eta_{ee}$ in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons
and modifies its %asymptotic temperature behavior. The efficiency of the
electron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron
stars is analyzed.</p>
