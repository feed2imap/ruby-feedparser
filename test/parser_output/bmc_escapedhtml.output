So MIT's 
<a href="http://www.techreview.com/">Technology Review</a> has named me as one of their
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/10/issue/feature_tr35.asp">TR35</a> -- the top 35 innovators under the age of thirty-five.  It's a great honor, especially because the other
honorees are <i>actually</i> working on things like
<a href="http://www.wi.mit.edu/research/fellows/brummelkamp.html">cures for cancer</a>
and
<a href="http://www.pw.utc.com/shock-system/popsci.html">rocket science</a> -- domains
that I have known only as rhetorical flourish.
Should you like to hear me make a jackass out of myself on the subject, you might
want to check out

in which he interviewed me about the award.
