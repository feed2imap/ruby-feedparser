On the Fedora front:

<p> FC3test2 is out (give it a try) and it's not too shabby.

<p> There's a bugweek possibly coming up next week - everyone who's anyone in Fedora working to sort through the bugs. More to come later.

<p> No, external CVS for Fedora has not been forgotten. Work is underway (and on Red Hat's side, we just underwent a  sizeable internal change that is necessary to support it).

<p> On the everything-else front:

The Fedora community can really use people who are willing to go through bugzilla and tame things down there. There are just a ton of bugs that the package maintainers will have no time to get to.
<p>
It's not the most exciting task, but it's something that almost anyone can help with in as small or large quantities as desired.
<p>
Also needed are community leaders for each of the architectures. E.g. Justin Forbes is The Man for AMD64, but we can always use peeps for ia64 and s390* :)

What's happening with Fedora lately:

<p> <ul><li>FC3test1 came out a little while ago.
<li>The devel tree is totally unfrozen again, so broken deps should be fixable if not fixed.
<li>CVS should be rolled out "soon"
</ul>

Cool link of the day is <a href="http://www.tradingbrain.com/" >TradingBrain</a>.

<p> If you added a user-login feature, you could use a neural network to combine individual responses into something meaningful. Neat experiment in distributed decision-making, in any case.

<p> FC2test3 is being pushed out and is on track for Monday release.

Only a few diary entries ago, I was complaining about the last company meeting. Now a new one is coming up, and I'm really looking forward to meeting all the great people that work at Red Hat.

It's 02:01, I can't sleep, and there's a bunch of company 
meetings today at 08:30 that appear increasingly boring as 
the time approaches. It sort of rains on my parade of TODO 
items - I could have finished libGIOP this 
week. Instead, the game seems 
to be snoozing through discussions of kernel hacking and 
attending suffocatingly purposeless cocktail parties. 
I need to get a potion distilled from the Smurf theme song 
and inject myself with it.
<p>
So I am bothering to write this at all because aaronl is 
being a total moron and I'm bored enough to respond:
<blockquote>"My biggest gripe about component architecture 
is that I just don't understand when it would ever be 
needed." -aaronl</blockquote>
So this essentially means that he has no clue why 
components are good, but everyone else must be wrong 
because he hasn't figured out how to use them. A classic 
example of his Bigger Problem - not understanding use cases 
beside his own exist.
<p>
<blockquote>"Sure, you can write code that will let you 
browse the web in Emacs (and such code has been writen), 
but this actually has to be implemented inside Emacs." -
aaronl</blockquote>
So this essentially means that he hasn't looked at how w3-
mode is actually implemented - it's a set of elisp files, 
aka... a component.
<p>
I must admit, however, that Aaron's perspective is 
refreshingly free from the burden of experience. In other 
words, dudes, I want some of that crack that he's smoking, 
because I seem to be having issues getting this dandelion 
to produce the pink elephants he's seeing.
<p>
Rather than go on a stupid campaign to rip out features 
which are generally needed, I suppose he could work on 
adding fine-grained conditional feature &amp; module selection, 
so he could build his bubble world more conveniently, not 
adversely impact those in the Big Blue Room, and benefit 
embedded systems builders in the process.
<p>
I'm done with the unprovoked insults and needless griping, 
so LART me and get back to your regularly scheduled world.
 I'm sure by lunchtime I'll have gotten enough sleep to 
regret this all.
